PCManFM is an extremely fast and lightweight GTK+ based file manager
which features tabbed browsing and a user-friendly interface.

If you have problems viewing icons on pcmanfm, include this line to
your $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0:
gtk-icon-theme-name="Tango"

By default the gtk+2 version is built: if you prefer to build the
gtk+3 one pass the script the parameter GTK=3, like

  GTK=3 ./pcmanfm.SlackBuild
